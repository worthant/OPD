# Laboratory work 6

Based on the variant given by the teacher, develop and explore the operation of a data exchange software complex in interrupt mode. The main program should modify the contents of a specified memory cell (X), which should be represented as a signed number. The range of allowable values for changing X should be limited by a given function F(X) and the design features of the data register of external device(ВУ) (8-bit signed representation). The interrupt processing program should output the modified value of X to the data register of external device(ВУ) according to the assignment variant, as well as ignore all unprocessed interrupts.
